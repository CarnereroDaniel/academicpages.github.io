This paper proposes a real-time battery management to promote the net-Zero Energy House (ZEH). We first introduce a forecasting method for solar power generation and electricity demand based on the history of residential electricity data. We next formulate an optimal storage battery management problem to maximize the profit from electricity trading based on the obtained forecast data and the battery capacity determined so that ZEH condition is satisfied. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulations are conducted using actual data in Jono Area, Kitakyushu City. Specifically, we conduct comparative studies on the one-year profit difference between the case with and without optimal management. It is then revealed that installing the batteries reduces electricity costs by an average of 53.6% for 125 residents, and real-time management further reduces the costs by an additional 8.7%.
