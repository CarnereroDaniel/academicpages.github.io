You can use the buttons above to access the different sections of this page. It might feel a bit empty at this point, but I will try to update little by little so that someday it can be regarded as a proper webpage.

Research Interests
======
My main research interests are the following:
* Model predictive control
* Machine learning for system identification
* Data-driven control
* Randomized algorithms

More concretely, recently I am interested in the combination of pure black-box models / data-driven control with first-principles-based models / control, which corresponds to my [most recent project](https://carnererodaniel.github.io/academicpages.github.io/projects/2025-03-01-project-1).

Control Information Systems Research Group
======
Currently, I am working with [Professor Sakurama](https://sites.google.com/view/sakuramakazunori-en/profile) in his laboratory at the University of Osaka. For a detailed description about the vision and purpose of the laboratory, I would like to refer the interested reader to the [following page](https://sites.google.com/view/sakuramakazunori-en/research). The member list can be found in the [following link](https://www.cis.sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/en).

About me
======
This is completely useless information and maybe it should not even be here, but I felt that the page was too empty so I decided to write something even though the probability that I will regret this later is extremely high. 
I came to Japan in 2023 for a postdoc and haven't left since then (with the exception of occasional visits to my family and the participation of international conferences). I can speak Spanish, English and Japanese (sometimes I feel like I cannot speak none of them though).
I like playing fighting games (mostly UNI and MB), cooking (generally Spanish or Japanese food), playing the drums (pop/EDM/rock/metal) and watching anime. To be honest, I would love to have a 3-day weekend every week so that I can dedicate more time to the things I want to do, but I don't feel like it's going to happen in the near future.
