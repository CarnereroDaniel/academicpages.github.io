You can use the buttons above to access the different section of this page. It might be feel a bit empty at this point, but I will try to keed it updated so that someday it can be regarded as a proper webpage.

Research Interests
======
My main research interests are the following:
* Model Predictive Control
* Machine Learning for system identification
* Data-driven control
* Randomized Algorithms
More concretely, lately I am interested in the combination of pure black-box models / data-driven control with first-principles-based models / control, which is my most [recent project](https://carnererodaniel.github.io/academicpages.github.io/projects/2025-03-01-project-1).

Control Information Systems Research Group
======
Currently, I am working with Professor Sakurama in his laboratory at the University of Osaka. For a detailed description of the vision and purpose of the laboratory, I would like to refer the interested reader to the [following page](https://sites.google.com/view/sakuramakazunori-en/research).

About me
======
I like playing fighting games (mostly UNI and MB), playing the drums, cooking and watching anime.
